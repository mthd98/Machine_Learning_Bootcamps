# AI DOJO Machine Learning Bootcamp

This is the repository for The Machine Learning Bootcamp Created for [AI DOJO](https://github.com/TheAIDojo). It contains all the Bootcamp code with supporting project files necessary to work through the code.

## Requirements and Setup

We recommend to use [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index), you will find Colab icon in the top of all AI DOJO code.
If you want to use your own pc please follow the instructions below:
1. Install Python on [Windows/Mac](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-387/).
2. Install pip for [Windows/Mac/Linux](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).
3. Make sure to install the necessary python packages for the Bootcamp from the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/TheAIDojo/Workshops/blob/main/requirements.txt) file.
4. Donwload the code editer, we recommend [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
